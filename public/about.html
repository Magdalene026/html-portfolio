    <p>Hey, my name is Magdalene! I was born and raised in the Vancouver, Washington area. I usually enjoy spending my time exploring
    areas that challenge me as a person. My hobbies usually entitle hands-on work and they offer many different growth opportunities.
    These range from being crafty with crocheting to writing poetry.</p>

    <p>Although Vancouver, WA is known for its rainy spells, being outside can still be quite pleasant. Despite the weather
      I love to go on nature walks and explore the outdoors. I love it just as much as I love riding my bike and being adventurous
      on windy trails.</p>

    <p>One of my dreams is to travel to all 50 states in the United States, each with its unique landscapes and cultures. This
      ambition  blends perfectly with my love for nature and adventure, promising a lifetime of discovery and inspiration.
